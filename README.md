## React Router Multi-Page App

This project demonstrates how to create separate pages using React Router.

## Description

The React Router Pages project is a sample application that showcases how to use React Router to create multiple pages within a React application. It includes the following pages:

- Stopwatch: A stopwatch component that measures time intervals with start, stop, resume, and reset functionality.
- Timer: A timer component that allows you to start, pause, resume, and reset the timer.
- World Clock: 3 clock component that displays the current time in different timezones and they also display the time difference of those cities compared to Tehran

Each page is implemented as a separate component and is rendered based on the URL using React Router
