#React Router Multi-Page App

This project demonstrates how to create separate pages using React Router.

## Description

The React Router Pages project is a sample application that showcases how to use React Router to create multiple pages within a React application. It includes the following pages:

- Stopwatch: A stopwatch component that measures time intervals with start, stop, resume, and reset functionality.
- Timer: A timer component that allows you to start, pause, resume, and reset the timer.
- World Clock: 3 clock component that displays the current time in different timezones.

Each page is implemented as a separate component and is rendered based on the URL using React Router.

## Installation

To run the React Router Pages project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone <repository_url>`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd react-router-pages`
3. Install the dependencies: `npm install` or `yarn install`
4. Start the development server: `npm start` or `yarn start`
5. Open your browser and visit `http://localhost:3000` to see the application running.

## Usage

The React Router Pages project demonstrates how to use React Router to create separate pages within a React application. It provides examples of different components, including a timer, stopwatch, and world clock, each accessible through its own route.

To navigate between the pages, use the following URLs:

- Timer: `http://localhost:3000/Timer`
- Stopwatch: `http://localhost:3000`
- Clock: `http://localhost:3000/WorldClock`

Feel free to explore the project's source code to see how each page is implemented using React Router.
